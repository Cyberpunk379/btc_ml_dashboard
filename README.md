# ðŸ§  Bitcoin ML Dashboard

A real-time Bitcoin trend classifier and price predictor powered by machine learning. Built using Streamlit, this dashboard shows hourly BTC price data, predicts short-term trends (Buy/Hold), and forecasts next-hour prices using trained classification and regression models.

## ðŸ“¸ Demo

![Demo](demo.gif)

> The dashboard lets you:
> - Run fresh inference on hourly BTC data
> - Visualize predicted uptrends vs. false positives
> - Track next-hour price forecasts from Ridge/Lasso
> - Export charts and raw CSVs for further analysis

## ðŸ§° ML Models Used

- **Classification**  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest (Tuned)  
  - XGBoost (Tuned)

- **Regression**  
  - Ridge Regression (Tuned)  
  - Lasso Regression  

All models are trained on engineered BTC features such as hourly returns, rolling means, and rolling standard deviations. The pipeline supports inference on the latest market data.
